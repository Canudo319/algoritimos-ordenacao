# algoritimos-ordenacao
A Simple software made with Java17 to give a sample of a Javafx17 project with some simple sorting algorithms

This project was made for one of my college activities at UNIP Jundia√≠.
Its is a Very simple Project with no extraordinary features, but its is a very good sample for a Javafx Aplication using JavaFX17 and MAVEN.

At the time I Had the necessity to make an exe app with JavaFX 17, That said, It was no Easy task doing so.

This project Was only made possible by using https://github.com/fvarrui/JavaPackager witch does compile an Java project into an EXE file

That said here is how the project turned out

#HomeScreen

The Only option is for the user to "Iniciar" witch means begin in portuguese

#Quantity Selection

You can select a Pre-Fixed amount of random data to sortby

#Ordenation Screen

With the quantity selected, you can now order by the sorting algoritm of your chosing, for now its suports the following ones:

  --Insertion
  
  --Bubble Sort
  
  --Quick Sort
  
  --Selection Sort
  
You can chose to sort either by latitude or by longitude

When you select the disired sorting algorithm, the application will start sorting, it will display the porcentage of how much progress was made

When it finhishes, it will display how much time has taken to sort as well as updating the list with the itens sorted

--Conclussion--

Despite being quite old at this point, JavaFX its a great way to build begginer friendly projects for you to understand a little bit more about Java, Java its an 
amazing language on its own, and JavaFx its a great way to get you started.

JavaFx is also a great production framework with focus is on reliability and agility to develop.

That said, I think that now a days, JavaFX isn't your number one choice for building applications, that are waayyyyy beter tools at the market for exe aplications ex.:
the JS Electron Framework, Flutter version 3 onward, C# and so much more.
